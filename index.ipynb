    "In this section you've learned a lot about importing, cleaning up, analysing (using descriptive statistics) and visualizing data. In this more free form project you'll get a chance to practice all of these skills with the Boston Housing data set,  which contains housing values in suburbs of Boston. The Boston Housing Data is commonly used by aspiring data scientists.  "

State how you think the 2 measures of centrality and/or dispersion might be different for each subset of the data. Examples of potential splits: DONE\n",
    "    - Create a 2 new dataframes based on your existing data, where one contains all the properties next to the Charles river, and the other one contains properties that aren't.\n",
    "    - Create 2 new dataframes based on a certain split for crime rate.\n",
